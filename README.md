# Problem Solving Workspace

This is a workspace for solving the programming challenge provided in the `question` directory. 

## Workspace Structure

```
.
├── question/       # Contains the problem description and related materials
├── solution/       # Your solution code and related files should be here
│   ├── main.py    # Main execution file for the solution
│   ├── result.txt # Final output of the solution
│   ├── tool/      # Available tools and utilities for you to use
│   ├── tmp/       # For temporary files during problem solving
│   └── ...        # Additional files and directories as needed
```

The `solution` directory is your workspace. You can create any additional directories and files as needed while solving the problem.

## Guidelines

1. Read and analyze the problem in the `question` directory
2. Utilize available tools in `solution/tool` directory
3. Implement your solution in the `solution` directory
4. Use `solution/main.py` as the entry point to execute the solution
5. Always output the final result to `solution/result.txt`
6. Store any temporary files in `solution/tmp`
